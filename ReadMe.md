Initial Readme for the SkiingAnalyzer software.

Design document can be found [here](Documentation/Suunnitteludokumentti.pdf).
As the development environment, we used pre-installed QT Creator on the schoolâ€™s 
virtual server. The application is also working on Windows 10 using QT Creator 
versions 4.11.2 and 4.8.2 and QT versions 5.14.2 and 5.12.1. To start the 
application user must run the [main.ccp file](SkiingAnalyzer/main.cpp).
